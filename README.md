# Analytics-Applications-Engineering

Welcome to the satellite imagery classification and categorization system built by Edwin Salguero. The application software incorporates cloud-based machine learning models to analyze satellite imagery data. The application is built using Python, Flask, JavaScript, Shell, YAML, and a Makefile, with machine learning algorithms supporting the backend computations. The application also is hosted on Google Cloud Platform and utilized continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to modify the code and update the application.
